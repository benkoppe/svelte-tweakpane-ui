import ExampleWrapper from '../../../components/docs/ExampleWrapper.astro';

Svelte Tweakpane UI exposes Tweakpane's robust theming system, and includes a few additional to make it easy to change the aesthetic of your tweakpanes.

Theme-related helpers are exposed on the `ThemeUtils` object, and a `Theme` type is also available to provide auto-completion and type safety when defining or overriding themes.

## Using bundled themes

`ThemeUtils.presets` provides default dark and light themes, plus all of the themes defined in the [Panepaint](https://tweakpane.github.io/docs/theming/#builder) theme building tool on the Tweakpane site.

Every Svelte Tweakpane UI component includes an optional `theme` prop, into which you can pass a `Theme` object. The `Theme` object can be a preset, a completely new theme of of your own creation, or a partial override of the global default theme (`standard`) by default.

### Minimal Theme Example

import ThemeBasic from '../../../examples/docs/svelte/ThemeBasic.svelte';
import ThemeBasicCode from '../../../examples/docs/markdown/ThemeBasic.md';

Passing a theme preset to the `theme` prop:

<ThemeBasicCode />

Applies the theme to a single component or pane on the page:

<ExampleWrapper>
  <ThemeBasic client:load />
</ExampleWrapper>

### Theme Picker Example

import ThemePicker from '../../../examples/docs/svelte/ThemePicker.svelte';
import ThemePickerCode from '../../../examples/docs/markdown/ThemePicker.md';

Use a `<List>` to browse and select from the available themes:

<ThemePickerCode />

<ExampleWrapper>
  <ThemePicker client:load />
</ExampleWrapper>

## Setting a global default

## Overriding individual values

## Creating a new theme

:::note
There's some additional logic behind the scenes on the documentation site to sync the Tweakpane theme with the documentation theme. The default Tweakpane theme is "dark" (`ThemeUtils.presets.standard`) regardless of `prefers-color-scheme`.
