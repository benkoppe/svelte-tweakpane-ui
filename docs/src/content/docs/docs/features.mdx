A handful of additional features have been implemented in the Svelte layer of the project.

## Additions

### Draggability

<video autoplay loop muted playsinline>
  <source src="/svelte-tweakpane-ui/draggability-demo.mp4" type="video/mp4" />

Your browser does not support the video tag.

</video>

With a single prop, you can make a `<Pane>` draggable and resizable. Position and size are persisted in local storage. (This is the default behavior for `<Pane>` components.)

What a time to be alive.

Pains were taken during development of this feature to ensure that draggable components behave appropriately on touch devices. It's true that Tweakpane's hit-zones are decidedly "mouse-first", but the [`scale`](/svelte-tweakpane-ui/docs/components/pane#scale) property on `<Pane>` can be used to make things more touch-friendly.

### Inline components

You can make a `<Pane>` appear inline with the rest of your content. (This is the default for standalone components.)

### Additional value types

In several places, additional value types are transparently supported.

Throughout the library, almost anything that takes an object will now also tolerate a tuple, and vice versa.

For example, `<Point>` can be used with a tuple, and `<CubicBezier>` can be used with an object.

This is particularly useful for interoperability with tuple-loving libraries like [Three.js](https://threejs.org) / [Threlte](https://threlte.xyz).

### Scaling

Tweakpane is nearly bitmap-free, so it scales up very nicely. _Svelte Tweakpane UI_ adds a `scale` prop to `<Pane>`s to allow you to scale your panes to any size you like.

### Scoped theming

_Svelte Tweakpane UI_ manages applying and overriding CSS variables at the right points in the dom to allow multiple panes to be styled independently on a single page.

### Global theming

A `setGlobalDefaultTheme()` helper function makes it easy to define a default theme for all panes on a page. (While still allowing individual panes to override the global default.)

### Element component

Sometimes you want to embed an arbitrary chunk of HTML in one of your panes. The `<Element>` component simplifies this.

### Live text updates

`<Text>` and `<Textarea>` components update their bound values every keystroke, not just on blur. (Though the old behavior remains is available via a prop.)

### Implicit Panes

Wrapping Tweakpane components in `<Pane>` components is optional. If you don't wrap a component in a `<Pane>`, it will be automatically wrapped in an implicit inline `<Pane>` with default settings.

### SSR Support _(experimental)_

Very, very, early and experimental support around SSR pre-rendering of pane width and height _only_. This is not true SSR, just some calculations to minimize CLS after hydration.

### Automatic collapsibility

Folders and inline pickers inside a draggable `<Pane>` can be set to automatically collapse if the screen is short on vertical space via the `collapseChildrenToFit` prop.

### Control user collapsibility

If you want to prevent the user from collapsing chunk of pane, you can set the `userExpandable` prop to `false`. The section will remain programmatically collapsible via the `expanded` property.

### Label truncation

Pane titles and blade labels are truncated with ellipses if they're too long to fit in their containers.

### Value change event origins

Though binding to a component's `value` is generally the best way to react to changes, sometimes you need to know _how_ a value's change originated.

To this end, all value-manipulating components provide a `change` event that includes the "origin" of the change in the `event.details` payload.

Changes resulting from the user's direct manipulation of the control are marked as `internal`, while those resulting from a change to the bound value from _outside_ the component are marked as `external`.

The example below tallies `internal` vs. `external` changes to the `<Slider>`:

<ExampleWrapper>
  <SvelteTweakpaneEventExample client:load />
</ExampleWrapper>

<details>
  <summary>See example code</summary>
  <SvelteTweakpaneEventExampleCode />
</details>

## Differences

Certain aspects of the Tweakpane API don't make a ton of sense in the Svelte context, and have been removed or hidden from the API.

### Custom containers

The [`container`](https://tweakpane.github.io/docs/misc/#container) [PaneConfig](https://tweakpane.github.io/docs/api/interfaces/_internal_.PaneConfig.html) option is not exposed, because correct placement in the containing DOM is managed by _Svelte Tweakpane UI_, and `<Pane position='inline' ...>` may be used where you'd like a pane to become part of the normal document flow.

### Visibility

The [`hidden`](https://tweakpane.github.io/docs/api/classes/Pane.html#hidden) / [visibility](https://tweakpane.github.io/docs/misc/#visibility) accessor is not exposed, because visibility a pane and its components may be managed directly in Svelte by adding / removing elements from the Svelte component markup through `{#if}` conditionals and similar.

### Order

[index](https://tweakpane.github.io/docs/misc/#insert) is not exposed. The order of controls appearance matches their position in the Svelte component markup.

### Disposal

_Svelte Tweakpane UI_ full manages the lifecycle of the underlying Tweakpane objects, obviating the need for manual calls to [dispose](https://tweakpane.github.io/docs/misc/#disposing).

### Import / export state

Abstractions around `importState()` and `exportState()` are not yet implemented. For now, Svelte provides many ways to load and persist values (stores, etc.).

### Plugins

A curation of first- and third-party Tweakpane Plugins have been wrapped in components and bundled with _Svelte Tweakpane UI_. These plugins are automatically registered on demand, and work just like other components.

### Tab rename

The vanilla Tweakpane `Tab` is referred to as a `<TabGroup>` in _Svelte Tweakpane UI_, and the vanilla Tweakpane `Page` is referred to as a `<TabPage>`.

### Params become props

The Vanilla Tweakpane API organizes control configuration into [`Params` interfaces and objects](https://tweakpane.github.io/docs/api/interfaces/_internal_.BindingParams.html). _Svelte Tweakpane UI_ pushes these values up into top-level props on each component.
