## Differences

Certain aspects of the Tweakpane API don't make a ton of sense in the Svelte context.

### Containers

- The [`container`](https://tweakpane.github.io/docs/misc/#container) [PaneConfig](https://tweakpane.github.io/docs/api/interfaces/_internal_.PaneConfig.html) option is not exposed, because correct placement in the containing DOM is managed by 'svelte-tweakpane-ui', and `<Pane position='inline' ...>` should be used where you'd like a pane to become part of the normal document flow.

### Visibility

- The [`hidden`](https://tweakpane.github.io/docs/api/classes/Pane.html#hidden) / [visibility](https://tweakpane.github.io/docs/misc/#visibility) accessor is not exposed, because visibility a pane and its components may be managed directly in Svelte by adding / removing elements from the component template through `{#if}` conditionals and similar.

### Order

- [index](https://tweakpane.github.io/docs/misc/#insert) is not exposed. The order of controls appearance matches their position in the component template.

### Disposal and Clean Up
