Introduction

## Plugins

Tweakpane is enriched by a [wide array of third-party component plugins](https://example.com/TODO). To keep these close at hand and to ensure plugin compatibility with Tweakpane version 4, this library includes a number of popular plugins right out of the box (while still allowing tree-shaking to keep the bundle size in check.)

`svelte-tweakpane-ui` takes a slightly different approach to plugins than the underlying vanilla JS Tweakpane API. Instead of explicitly `npm` installing, importing, and then registering plugins on a `Pane` object, `svelte-tweakpane-ui` manages plugin import and registration automatically the first time they're used.

From the user's perspective, they're just another component.

Many of the most popular Tweakpane plugins are already bundled with `svelte-tweakpane-ui`, and have been "wrapped" according to the conventions of the library.

To keep bundle size down, it's recommended to use [per-component imports](https://example.com/TODO) when you're ready to go to production.

### Bundled and integrated

The following plugins are included with `svelte-tweakpane-ui`, and are ready to use out of the box:

- [CameraKit](https://github.com/tweakpane/plugin-camerakit) `<Ring>`, `<Wheel>`
- [Essentials](https://github.com/tweakpane/plugin-essentials) `<ButtonGrid>`, `<RadioGrid>`, `<CubicBezier>`, `<FpsGraph>`, `<Interval>`
- [Image](https://github.com/kitschpatrol/tweakpane-image-plugin) `<Image>` _(forked from [ayamflow](https://github.com/ayamflow/tweakpane-image-plugin), [metehus](https://github.com/metehus/tweakpane-image-plugin), and [repalash](https://github.com/repalash/tweakpane-image-plugin) and ported to v4)\*_
- [Profiler](https://github.com/0b5vr/tweakpane-plugin-profiler) `<Profiler>`
- [Rotation](https://github.com/0b5vr/tweakpane-plugin-rotation) `<RotationQuaternion>`, `<RotationEuler>`
- [Textarea](https://github.com/kitschpatrol/tweakpane-textarea-plugin) `<Textarea>` _(forked from [panGenerator](https://github.com/panGenerator/tweakpane-textarea-plugin) and ported to v4)\*_
- [Waveform](https://github.com/kitschpatrol/tweakpane-plugin-waveform) `<Waveform>`

_\*Tweakpane version 4 is a relatively recent release, and it introduced a number of breaking changes for plugin developers. I've ported the asterisked plugins above from Tweakpane 3 to Tweakpane 4, and and submitted PRs to the project owners. As soon as the PRs are merged, I will update the dependencies in `svelte-tweakpane-ui` to point to the source instead of my fork._
