Svelte 4
Tweakpane 4

**A [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) component library wrapping UI elements from [Tweakpane](https://cocopon.github.io/tweakpane/), plus some additional functionality for convenience and flexibility.**

The components should be useful for quickly integrating controls and value monitoring in parametrically driven artworks or simulations. For some use cases, it could also present a viable alternative to traditional component libraries altogether.

Tweakpane represents many years of development effort by [Hiroki Kokubun](https://cocopon.me). The library's visual design offers a highly legible aesthetic, and its implementation provides fine specimens of many controls that are often a bit clunky in general-purpose component libraries.

Please see the [acknowledgements](/docs/acknowledgments) for a list of contributors to the underlying projects.

## Design Approach

### Batteries included

### Layered API

This component collection exposes both the core building blocks of Tweakpane's vanilla JS API as Svelte components (e.g. `Bindings`, `Folder`, `Pane`, etc.), and builds on this foundation to provide a number of more specific components which provide both convenience, clarity of intent, and improved auto-completion through type narrowing (e.g. `Slider`, `Point`, etc.).

These more specific components trade some flexibility for ease of use, but if you don't care for that tradeoff the higher level components remain available for use.

### Let Svelte bind

Vanilla Tweakpane conveniently provides two-way bindings for manipulating object properties, but `svelte-tweakpane-ui` leaves binding up to the user via [Svelte's conventional approach](https://example.com/TODO). This makes bindings explicit, and allows most components to function either as monitors or inputs depending on whether their value property is bound.

Note that unlike vanilla Tweakpane, no explicit Plugin module import or registration is required in 'svelte-tweakpane-ui'.

### Svelte Tweakpane Wrappers

Two other projects provide integration between Tweakpane and Svelte:

- [svelte-tweakpane](https://github.com/pierogis/svelte-tweakpane) by [Karl Moore](https://pierogis.live)
- [svelte-pane](https://github.com/mattcroat/svelte-pane) by [Matija](https://matia.xyz/)

`svelte-tweakpane-ui` drew some inspiration from these projects, but was developed independently. The `-ui` suffix in `svelte-tweakpane-ui` is to avoid a naming collision with Karl Moore's work.
