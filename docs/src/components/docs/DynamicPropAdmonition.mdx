:::note[Dynamic Props]

**This component has dynamic props, which means the available props can change depending on the value or type of _other_ props.**

Props contingent on certain conditions are annotated below with a <Flags names={["dynamic"]} /> flag, and include explanations of the "conditions" affecting the prop's availability. [More Info&thinsp;â†’](/svelte-tweakpane-ui/docs#dynamic-props)
